1. All agents are vibrating -- trembling
2. An idea emerges, visualized as a ball rising from baseline and taking on a certain color
3. Its presence creates some probability that its neighbors will find the idea catching -- and if the idea catches, they take on the color, and rise
4. The more neighbors the sway of a particular idea, the higher the chance that an agent will find itself caught up in the idea as well
5. At any moment, there's a chance that an agent will lose the idea, and return to its baseline state -- its original position and color
6. I didn't code for this part, but if an idea succeeds in sweeping the entire board, it becomes the new baseline -- it is locked in, and it is the new origin from which new concepts may (and will) arise
